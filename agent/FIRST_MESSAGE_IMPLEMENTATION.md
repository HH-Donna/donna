# First Message Implementation Guide

## Overview

The agent's first message has been successfully configured with dynamic variables. This ensures Donna speaks **immediately** when the call connects, without waiting for the user to say "hello".

## Configuration Status ‚úÖ

### Agent Config: `donna-billing-verifier.json`

**Location:** 
- Dev: `/agent/agent_configs/dev/donna-billing-verifier.json`
- Prod: `/agent/agent_configs/prod/donna-billing-verifier.json`

**First Message Template:**
```
Hi, this is Donna calling from {{customer_org}} about case {{case_id}}. 
{{policy_recording_notice}} I'm calling to verify an invoice we received 
that appears to come from {{email__vendor_name}}‚Äîinvoice {{email__invoice_number}} 
for {{email__amount}}, due {{email__due_date}}. Are you the right person to 
confirm whether this was issued by your billing department?
```

### Dynamic Variables Used

All 7 required dynamic variables are properly configured:

1. ‚úÖ `{{customer_org}}` - Customer organization name (e.g., "Pixamp Inc")
2. ‚úÖ `{{case_id}}` - Unique case identifier (e.g., "FRAUD-2024-001")
3. ‚úÖ `{{policy_recording_notice}}` - Recording consent notice
4. ‚úÖ `{{email__vendor_name}}` - Vendor name from email (e.g., "AWS")
5. ‚úÖ `{{email__invoice_number}}` - Invoice number (e.g., "INV-2024-12345")
6. ‚úÖ `{{email__amount}}` - Invoice amount (e.g., "$1,250.00")
7. ‚úÖ `{{email__due_date}}` - Invoice due date (e.g., "October 15, 2024")

### Example First Message (with variables substituted)

> "Hi, this is Donna calling from Pixamp Inc about case FRAUD-2024-001. This call may be recorded for quality assurance. I'm calling to verify an invoice we received that appears to come from AWS‚Äîinvoice INV-2024-12345 for $1,250.00, due October 15, 2024. Are you the right person to confirm whether this was issued by your billing department?"

## Override Settings ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status:** Overrides are **DISABLED** for `first_message`

**What this means:**
- The same first message template is used for all calls
- You cannot customize the first message on a per-call basis
- This is the correct setting for most use cases
- Dynamic variables are still substituted automatically

**To enable overrides** (if needed in the future):

In `platform_settings.overrides.conversation_config_override.agent`:
```json
{
  "first_message": true  // Currently: false
}
```

**Reference:** https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/customization/personalization/overrides

## Testing

### Configuration Test (Non-Interactive)

Tests that the agent config is properly set up:

```bash
cd api
python3 test_first_message_config.py
```

**What it checks:**
- ‚úÖ Agent config file exists
- ‚úÖ First message is configured (not empty)
- ‚úÖ All required dynamic variables are defined
- ‚úÖ Shows example with variables substituted

### Live Call Test (Interactive)

Tests the first message with a real phone call:

```bash
cd api
python3 test_first_message_live.py +13473580012
```

**What it tests:**
1. Initiates a real call to the specified number
2. Verifies Donna speaks immediately (without waiting for "hello")
3. Checks that all dynamic variables are properly substituted
4. Fetches and displays the call transcript

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Answer the call
- [ ] DO NOT say "hello" first
- [ ] Verify Donna speaks immediately
- [ ] Verify she mentions: customer_org, case_id, vendor_name, invoice_number, amount, due_date
- [ ] Verify recording notice is included
- [ ] Verify she asks the billing verification question

### End-to-End Test (Comprehensive)

Full test suite including config validation and optional live call:

```bash
cd api
python3 test_first_message_e2e.py
```

**Test Coverage:**
1. Agent config exists
2. First message configured
3. Dynamic variables defined
4. Override settings check
5. Live call test (optional)
6. Transcript verification

## How It Works

### Call Flow

1. **Call Initiated:** ElevenLabs initiates call via Twilio
2. **Call Connects:** Recipient answers the phone
3. **First Message Plays:** Donna immediately speaks the configured first message
   - No waiting for user input
   - No waiting for "hello"
   - Dynamic variables are pre-substituted
4. **Conversation Begins:** After first message, normal conversation flow continues

### Dynamic Variable Substitution

When you initiate a call, pass the dynamic variables:

```python
payload = {
    "agent_id": AGENT_ID,
    "to_phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "dynamic_variables": {
        "customer_org": "Pixamp Inc",
        "case_id": "FRAUD-2024-001",
        "email__vendor_name": "AWS",
        "email__invoice_number": "INV-123",
        "email__amount": "$1,250.00",
        "email__due_date": "October 15, 2024",
        "policy_recording_notice": "This call may be recorded...",
        # ... other variables
    }
}
```

ElevenLabs automatically:
1. Takes the `first_message` template from agent config
2. Substitutes all `{{variable}}` placeholders with actual values
3. Speaks the rendered message immediately when call connects

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: First message doesn't play

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `first_message` is not empty in agent config
2. Check that agent is updated in ElevenLabs dashboard
3. Ensure dynamic variables are passed when initiating call

### Problem: First message waits for "hello"

**Solutions:**
1. This was the original issue - now fixed!
2. Having a configured `first_message` ensures immediate playback
3. Verify config with: `python3 test_first_message_config.py`

### Problem: Variables not substituted (shows {{variable_name}})

**Solutions:**
1. Verify variables are passed in `dynamic_variables` payload
2. Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Verify variables are defined in agent config's `dynamic_variable_placeholders`

### Problem: First message too long or too short

**Solutions:**
1. Edit the `first_message` field in agent config
2. Keep it concise but informative (current: 363 characters)
3. Maintain professional tone and include required disclosures

## Reference Documentation
