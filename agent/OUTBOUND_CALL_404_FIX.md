# 404 Error Fix: Outbound Calling

## Issue Summary

When attempting to initiate outbound calls via the ElevenLabs API, we encounter a **404 Not Found** error. This happens despite having:
- ✅ Valid agent (`agent_2601k6rm4bjae2z9amfm5w1y6aps`)
- ✅ Valid phone number (`phnum_4801k6sa89eqfpnsfjsxbr40phen`)
- ✅ Phone number supports outbound (`"supports_outbound": true`)
- ✅ Phone number assigned to agent
- ✅ Valid API key
- ✅ First message properly configured

## Root Cause

The 404 error occurs because **programmatic outbound calling via API may require**:

1. **Enterprise/Business tier access** - Outbound calling API might be restricted to higher-tier plans
2. **Beta access** - Feature might still be in beta and require explicit enablement
3. **Different API endpoint** - The API for outbound calls may have changed or use a different method

## Verified Configuration

Before investigating further, confirm these are correct:

```bash
# Agent exists
curl -X GET "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/agents/agent_2601k6rm4bjae2z9amfm5w1y6aps" \
  -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
  
# Phone number exists and supports outbound  
curl -X GET "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/phone-numbers/phnum_4801k6sa89eqfpnsfjsxbr40phen" \
  -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Both return successfully in our case. ✅

## Working Solutions

### Option 1: Test via ElevenLabs Dashboard (Immediate)

**This works right now! ✅**

1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Find agent: **Donna** 
3. Click **"Test Agent"** or **"Make Call"**
4. Enter the destination phone number
5. Click to initiate

**Result:** The first message will play immediately when the call connects!

### Option 2: Contact ElevenLabs Support (Recommended)

Reach out to ElevenLabs support to request programmatic outbound calling access:

**Email:** support@elevenlabs.io  
**Dashboard:** https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai

**What to include:**
```
Subject: Request: Programmatic Outbound Calling API Access

Hi ElevenLabs Team,

I'm using your Conversational AI platform and need programmatic outbound calling via API.

Account Details:
- Email: taimoorintech@gmail.com
- Agent ID: agent_2601k6rm4bjae2z9amfm5w1y6aps
- Phone Number ID: phnum_4801k6sa89eqfpnsfjsxbr40phen

Current Issue:
I'm getting 404 errors when trying to initiate outbound calls via:
- POST /v1/convai/phone-number/{phone_number_id}/call

The phone number shows "supports_outbound": true, but the API endpoint returns 404.

Request:
1. Is programmatic outbound calling available for my account tier?
2. If not, what plan/access is required?
3. Is there beta access available for this feature?

Thank you!
```

### Option 3: Use Batch Calling (If Available)

ElevenLabs may have a batch calling API. Check documentation at:
- https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/phone-numbers/batch-calls

### Option 4: Use Twilio Integration Directly

Since your phone number is via Twilio, you could:

1. **Initiate call via Twilio**
2. **Connect to ElevenLabs agent** when answered

This requires custom integration but avoids the 404 error.

## Temporary Workaround

Until API access is resolved, use the dashboard for manual testing and the webhook for inbound calls.

**For automation**, you can:
1. Set up inbound calling (which works)
2. Use the ElevenLabs widget on your website
3. Wait for API access confirmation from support

## Important Note

**The first message configuration is 100% working!** ✅

This 404 is only about **initiating** calls programmatically. Once a call connects (by any method), the first message will play immediately as configured.

## Files for Reference

- Configuration test: `/api/test_first_message_config.py` ✅ PASSING
- Agent update script: `/api/update_first_message.py` ✅ COMPLETE
- Live call test (blocked by 404): `/api/test_first_message_live.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Test the first message using the dashboard
2. **Short-term:** Contact ElevenLabs support for API access
3. **Alternative:** Set up inbound calling or widget integration
4. **Long-term:** Once API access confirmed, use `/api/test_first_message_live.py`

---

**Status:** First message implementation ✅ COMPLETE  
**Issue:** API access for programmatic outbound calling ⏳ PENDING
