# System Prompt Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

Successfully integrated your custom system prompt with full email and user context injection into the ElevenLabs agent.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Dynamic Variables (`eleven_agent.py`)

**Before:**
```python
variables = {
    "vendor__legal_name": company_name,
    "vendor_email": email,
    "customer_org": company_name,
    "customer_name": user_info.get('user_name', 'the customer'),
    # ... limited variables
}
```

**After:**
```python
variables = {
    # Vendor/Company being called
    "vendor_name": company_name,
    "vendor_email": email,
    "vendor_phone": email_data.get('vendor_phone', ''),
    
    # Client information (the user)
    "client_name": user_info.get('user_name', 'my client'),
    "client_email": user_info.get('user_email', ''),
    "client_phone": user_info.get('user_phone', ''),
    "client_company": user_info.get('user_company', ''),
    
    # Invoice/Email context
    "invoice_subject": email_data.get('subject', 'Invoice'),
    "invoice_from": email_data.get('from_address', email),
    "invoice_date": email_data.get('date', 'recently'),
    "invoice_id": email_data.get('invoice_id', 'N/A'),
    "invoice_amount": email_data.get('amount', 'N/A'),
    "email_snippet": email_data.get('snippet', '')[:200],
}
```

---

### 2. Added Email Data Parameter

**Updated Function Signature:**
```python
async def verify_company_by_call(
    self,
    company_name: str,
    phone_number: str,
    email: str,
    user_uuid: Optional[str] = None,
    email_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None  # NEW!
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

---

### 3. Email Context Extraction (`domain_checker.py`)

**Added automatic extraction:**
```python
# Extract invoice data from email for context
email_data = {
    'subject': subject,
    'from_address': from_address,
    'date': parsed_data.get('headers', {}).get('date', ''),
    'snippet': gmail_msg.get('snippet', '')[:200],
}

# Extract invoice ID and amount from body text
if body_text:
    extracted_fields = extract_kv_from_text(body_text)
    email_data['invoice_id'] = extracted_fields.get('invoice_number', 'N/A')
    email_data['amount'] = extracted_fields.get('total', 'N/A')
```

## 🎯 System Prompt (Configured in ElevenLabs)

Your prompt is integrated following your specifications:

```
Personality: You are Donna, an efficient but friendly invoice verifier

Goal: Call on behalf of {{client_name}} to verify invoice from {{vendor_name}}

Call Flow:
1. Introduce yourself: "Hi, this is Donna calling on behalf of {{client_name}} 
   from {{client_company}}. I'm verifying an invoice from {{vendor_name}}."

2. Provide details: Invoice {{invoice_id}}, amount {{invoice_amount}}, 
   dated {{invoice_date}}

3. Ask verification: "Can you confirm this invoice was sent by your company?"

4. Handle responses flexibly

5. Confirm client contact: "Would you like to reach {{client_name}} at 
   {{client_email}} or {{client_phone}}?"

Tone: Clear, concise, friendly, natural (not robotic)
Error Handling: Flexible with anomalies
Guardrails: Only invoice verification, no unrelated conversations
```

**Full prompt:** See `ELEVENLABS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`

## 📊 Variable Extraction

### Automatic Extraction from Email:

1. **Subject** - Directly from email headers
2. **From Address** - Parsed from sender
3. **Date** - From email headers
4. **Snippet** - First 200 chars from Gmail
5. **Invoice ID** - Regex patterns:
   - `Invoice #12345`
   - `INV-2025-001`
   - `Bill No: 12345`
6. **Amount** - Regex patterns:
   - `$1,500.00`
   - `£150.50`
   - `Total: $500`

## 🎨 Conversation Example

**Real Call Flow:**

**Donna:** "Hi, this is Donna calling on behalf of John Smith from Acme Corp. I'm helping them verify an invoice email they received from Shopify at billing@shopify.com. Is this the right department?"

**Agent:** "Yes, this is billing."

**Donna:** "Great! John received invoice number INV-12345 for $150.50, dated October 5th, with subject 'Monthly Subscription Invoice'. Can you confirm this was sent by your company?"

**Agent:** "Let me check... Yes, confirmed."

**Donna:** "Perfect! Should John proceed with payment?"

**Agent:** "Yes, it's legitimate."

**Donna:** "Thank you! Would you like to reach John at john.smith@acme.com if there are questions?"

**Agent:** "No, that's fine."

**Donna:** "Thanks for your help. Have a great day!"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Variables Show as {{client_name}}

**Cause:** ElevenLabs not recognizing variables

**Fix:** Ensure proper format in dashboard: `{{variable_name}}`

### Missing Invoice Details

**Cause:** Email body doesn't contain invoice info

**Fix:** Variables will show "N/A" - agent will still work

### User Name is "my client"

**Cause:** User not in profiles table or user_uuid not passed

**Fix:** Check database and function calls
