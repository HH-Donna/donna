**Subject:** Unable to Find Batch Calling Terms & Conditions to Accept

**Message:**

Hello ElevenLabs Support Team,

I'm trying to use the Conversational AI batch calling feature via your API, but I'm receiving this error:

```
status: 'batch_calling_agreement_required'
message: 'Please accept the batch calling Terms & Conditions in the application to use this feature.'
```

**My Issue:**
I cannot find where to accept these terms in the application. I have checked:
- The batch calling page (https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/batch-calling)
- Settings page
- Phone numbers page
- Tried creating test calls in the dashboard

No popup or terms acceptance dialog appears.

**My Account Details:**
- API Key: sk_9af95a2... (starts with this)
- Feature needed: Batch calling / Outbound calls with Conversational AI
- Use case: Automated fraud verification calls

**Request:**
Could you please either:
1. Show me where to find and accept the batch calling terms, OR
2. Enable batch calling on my account manually

Thank you for your help!
